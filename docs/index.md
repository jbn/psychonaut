# psychonaut docs

`psychonaut` is an async python {`bsky`, `atp`} x {`sdk`, `cli`}. 

It is a weekend-project WIP, so use at you're own risk. However,
I am using it for a bunch of things, so it's not completely broken.
And as long as you pin the version you're using (until this thing
gets more stable) you should be fine.
